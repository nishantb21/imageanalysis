Object Detection using OpenCV 3.2.0

This is a program written in C++ using OpenCV 3.2.0 to create an Support Vector Machine which is able to distinguish objects from each other. Our aim is to write code which is able to distinguish images containing garbage from images which dont contain garbage. We have taken the approach as described by skm on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31414782/image-classification-in-opencv-python-based-on-training-set. However this approach needed to tweaked quite a bit to mould into the new OpenCV 3.2.0 library. This code was executed successfully on a Windows 10 machine running Visual Studio 2015 with all the latest updates installed. The library was compiled seperately from the source with the inclusion of the additional opencv-contrib package to make use of the non-free algorithms. A clear description of the approach has been given in the main source code in the form of comments.
